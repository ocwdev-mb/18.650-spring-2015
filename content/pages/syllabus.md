Textbook
--------

Rice, John A. _Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis_. Duxbury Press, 2006. ISBN: 9780534399429. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=EKA-yeX2GVgC&printsec=frontcover)\]

Statistics Package
------------------

We will use the R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. For more information and to download the software, visit [The R Project for Statistical Computing site](http://www.r-project.org/).

We will also use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a free and open source integrated development environment (IDE) for R. [RStudio Desktop](https://cran.rstudio.com/), allows the program to run locally as a regular desktop application.

Assignments & Exams
-------------------

There are 10 problem sets. None will be due in weeks when there are exams. During the term there are three exams, equally spaced during the course. There is no final exam.
